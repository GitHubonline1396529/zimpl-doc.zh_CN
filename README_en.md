# A Chinese Translation for Zimpl User's Guide

Zimpl is a little language to translate the mathematical model of a problem into a linear or (mixed-)integer mathematical program expressed in `.lp` or `.mps` file format which can be read by a `LP` or `MIP` solver. This project aims to Translate the *Zimpl User's Guide* into Chinese.

There are two reasons that prompted me to translate this manual. One is that, Zimpl is very user-friendly, and many people in China should be able to use it, especially for college students; Another reason is that I found out that the English Zimpl documentation, as an open-source document licensed with GNU, is [being sold with clear pricing on CSDN](https://wenku.csdn.net/doc/2st7t0m7ou), which makes me very angry. So, I hope I can provide a Chinese version of the document for Chinese users.

The original manual has a total of 7 chapters and is constantly being updated. In the latest translation the section 1 to 5 and section 7 has been completed. Considering that there still remains lots of content that needs to be translated, I decided to upload the file to GitHub to seek for cooperations. I warmly welcome anyone to provide assistance.
